Salient Object Detection in Natural Scene Â   
----jikang Wang's  Undergraduate thesis
==================
## Abstract: 

The core goal of computer vision is to understand the surrounding environment through computer. In order to accomplish this goal, the following three tasks need to be done: the most important object in the perception scene, the object contour and the context of the perceived object. And the basis of these works is to obtain the significance of the image information. The significance information of the image can reflect the degree of stimulation of the image in different regions under the human visual system. So as to provide the basis for subsequent image segmentation, image retrieval, image editing and other applications.
In this paper, we study the differences and advantages of different algorithms by studying the principle of each significant algorithm. In this paper, the ITTI algorithm based on the biometric vision mechanism is studied in detail. FT algorithm based on the frequency-tuned and the most popular GC algorithm, the algorithm is used to test the target detection under different scenarios is measured by testing each algorithm. In addition, three classical segmentation algorithms are introduced, and the results of different algorithms are segmented, and the application of each segmentation algorithm to each significant graph is compared. Finally, through the MFC-based significance detection system, these algorithms are combined to facilitate follow-up developers to compare the superiority and applicability of the algorithm.'

# How to run it?
Before you try to run it, download the source code from Ming-Ming Cheng's research projects and try to understand it.
For Chinese Students Please Read my [blog](http://www.cnblogs.com/cnblogs321114287/p/6543837.html)
I design a MFC GUI for users to test images and segment it. The file Showjpg is the GUI file, The code also link with Matlab because some algorithms is written in Matlab, but I also warp the matlab library with them, so you can use it without install Matlab.
For the file size limitation, I can't upload my final exe file, so you need to complie it. I'm sure I already upload all the core code, so try to read it and feel free to use it in your project.
